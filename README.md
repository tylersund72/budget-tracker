# Budget Tracker Starter Code

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 


GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated

You’ll need to use IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Review Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 4: Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

You’ll also need to add a service worker to your application. Review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 4: Using Service Workers as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

<!-- This manifest.json file for this project will contain the following properties:

name

short_name

icons

theme_color

background_color

start_url

display -->

In the module project, you used webpack to create the manifest.json file. For this application, you’ll need to create it manually and add it to the root of the public/ directory of your application. You can also review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 5: Convert the App to a PWA as a refresher on web manifests.

Finally, the budget tracker has a server and uses MongoDB as its database, so you’ll need to deploy this application to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas. To review this process, look at Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 5: Add Mongoose Validation, specifically 18.5.5: Deploy to Heroku.
